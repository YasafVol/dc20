# DC20 Character Creator - Project Status

## Current Status (June 25, 2025)

The project has successfully completed the merge of Character Creation Stages A, B, and C into a single page and the full population of static rule data. The core UI foundation is stable. The next steps involve comprehensive testing of the merged functionality and proceeding with the implementation of the remaining character creation stages (D-F).

### Completed Tasks

1.  **Character Creation Stages A, B, C Merged:**
    -   The functionality of the original Stage A (Attributes), Stage B (Ancestry), and Stage C (Class) has been successfully merged into a single Svelte page component (`src/routes/character-creator/+page.svelte`).
    -   A new unified API endpoint (`src/routes/api/character/progress/complete/+server.ts`) is implemented to handle saving all data for the merged stages in one request.
    -   The old stage-specific page components and API endpoints have been superseded and moved to a backup directory (`_backup_merge_stages_20250621/`).
2.  **Static Rule Data Population Completed:**
    -   The static rule data files (`src/lib/rulesdata/*.ts`) have been fully populated with detailed information for attributes, ancestries, classes, skills, traits, languages, and trades based on the DC20 Beta 0.9.5 rulebook.
3.  **Core UI Foundation Completed:**
    -   Functional SvelteKit project initialized and configured.
    -   TailwindCSS installed and configured with the project's custom theme, verified.
    -   The Inter font loaded and applied.
    -   Melt UI (`@melt-ui/svelte`) installed, and its preprocessor (`@melt-ui/pp`) correctly configured.
4.  **Documentation Updated:**
    -   The memory bank documentation (`memory-bank/`) and project plan documents (`projectPlan/`) have been updated to reflect the completed stage merge and static data population.
5.  **Database Setup:**
    -   Installed and configured PostgreSQL locally.
    -   Created `dc20-local` database.
    -   Set up environment variables in `.env` file.
    -   Generated Prisma client.
    -   Applied initial migration to create database schema.
    -   Configured `prisma/schema.prisma` with `CharacterInProgress` and `CharacterSheetData` models.

### Current Work / Next Steps

1.  Thoroughly test the merged character creation page (`src/routes/character-creator/+page.svelte`) and the unified save API endpoint (`src/routes/api/character/progress/complete/+server.ts`).
2.  Address any bugs or issues found during testing.
3.  Detail and implement Stage D (Background) of the character creation process.
4.  Detail and implement Stage E (Review) of the character creation process.
5.  Detail and implement Stage F (Equipment) of the character creation process.
6.  Implement the backend logic for final character calculation and `CharacterSheetData` creation upon completion of Stage F.
7.  Implement the frontend component for displaying the finalized character sheet.
8.  Refine UI/UX based on testing and feedback.
9.  Address outstanding technical debt items (see `projectPlan/techDesignDebt.md`).

## Project Context

The DC20 Character Creator is a web application designed to help players create Level 1 characters for the DC20 tabletop roleplaying game. The application follows a guided process, with the initial stages (A, B, C) now integrated into a single page.

### Key Features (MVP)

-   Level 1 Character Creation Page (incorporating functionality of original Stages A, B, C).
-   Point Buy system for attributes.
-   Ancestry selection and trait allocation.
-   Class selection and feature choices.
-   Data persistence using PostgreSQL via a unified API endpoint for the A-B-C data block.
-   Character Page Output displaying finalized Level 1 data (planned).
-   Basic resume creation functionality using browser localStorage (planned).
-   Dark mode UI with a modern aesthetic.

### Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** SvelteKit, Melt UI, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend:** SvelteKit API Routes
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
-   **State Management:** Svelte stores

### Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture using SvelteKit. Frontend components handle the user interface and client-side logic, while backend endpoints handle data persistence, validation, and final calculations. The database stores both in-progress character data and finalized character sheets. The initial character creation stages (A, B, C) are now handled by a single page component and a single unified API endpoint for saving.

## Resources

-   Detailed planning documents in `projectPlan/` directory
-   Memory bank documentation in `memory-bank/` directory
-   Static rule data in `src/lib/rulesdata/` directory
-   Database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
