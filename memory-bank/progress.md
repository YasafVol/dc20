# Progress

This document summarizes the current status of the project, including what has been completed, what remains, and any known issues.

## What Works

- **Character Creation Stages A, B, C Merged:**
    - The functionality of the original Stage A (Attributes), Stage B (Ancestry), and Stage C (Class) has been successfully merged into a single Svelte page component (`src/routes/character-creator/+page.svelte`).
    - A new unified API endpoint (`src/routes/api/character/progress/complete/+server.ts`) is implemented to handle saving all data for the merged stages in one request.
    - The old stage-specific page components and API endpoints have been superseded and moved to a backup directory (`_backup_merge_stages_20250621/`).
- **Static Rule Data Population Completed:**
    - The static rule data files (`src/lib/rulesdata/*.ts`) have been fully populated with detailed information for attributes, ancestries, classes, skills, traits, languages, and trades based on the DC20 Beta 0.9.5 rulebook.
- **Core UI Foundation Completed:**
    - Functional SvelteKit project initialized and configured.
    - TailwindCSS installed and configured with the project's custom theme, verified.
    - The Inter font loaded and applied.
    - Melt UI (`@melt-ui/svelte`) installed, and its preprocessor (`@melt-ui/pp`) correctly configured.
- **Documentation Updated:**
    - The memory bank documentation (`memory-bank/`) and project plan documents (`projectPlan/`) have been updated to reflect the completed stage merge and static data population.
- The core technologies, UI design principles, MVP feature scope, data modeling (Prisma schema), key backend logic, key frontend logic, and specific planning decisions for the Level 1 Character Creator MVP are defined and reflected in the codebase.

## What's Left to Build

The immediate focus has shifted to the Vercel migration as outlined in `projectPlan/cleanVercelMigration.md`. The remaining character creation stages (D-F) and associated backend/frontend implementations are currently on hold until the deployment issues are resolved.

**Current Priority: Vercel Migration**
- **Phase 1: Baseline Verification (Vercel)**
    - Create a new SvelteKit skeleton project in a `dc20-clean` directory.
    - Install `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` and configure `svelte.config.js`.
    - Deploy to Vercel to confirm fundamental build process and Vercel adapter are working correctly.
- **Phase 2: Database Layer Verification (Vercel)**
- **Phase 3: API Logic Verification (Vercel)**
- **Phase 4: UI and Integration Verification (Vercel)**
- **Phase 5: Final Production Deployment**

**Subsequent Tasks (After Vercel Migration):**
- Thoroughly test the merged character creation page and the unified save API endpoint.
- Address any bugs or issues found during testing.
- Detail and implement Stage D (Background) of the character creation process.
- Detail and implement Stage E (Review) of the character creation process.
- Detail and implement Stage F (Equipment) of the character creation process.
- Implement the backend logic for final character calculation and `CharacterSheetData` creation upon completion of Stage F.
- Implement the frontend component for displaying the finalized character sheet.
- Refine UI/UX based on testing and feedback.
- Address outstanding technical debt items (see `projectPlan/techDesignDebt.md`).

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed the merge of Character Creation Stages A, B, and C into a single page and the full population of static rule data. The core UI foundation is stable. However, persistent Vercel deployment issues have necessitated a shift in focus. The project is now prioritizing a clean migration to Vercel, following the incremental testing strategy outlined in `projectPlan/cleanVercelMigration.md`.

## Known Issues

- Melt UI SSR compatibility issue with wrapped components (TD-005), leading to the use of standard HTML elements in some parts of the merged page.
- Outstanding technical debt items are tracked in `projectPlan/techDesignDebt.md`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The SvelteKit project was initialized manually to work within the existing project structure.
- The necessity of installing and configuring the `@melt-ui/pp` preprocessor for Melt UI was identified and implemented during Stage 0.
- The decision to initially store static rule data in TypeScript files was made for simplicity during the MVP phase, with a potential future plan to move it to the database.
- The character creation wizard stages were re-ordered from the original DC20 steps to A-Attributes, B-Ancestry, C-Class, D-Background, E-Review, F-Equipment for a more streamlined digital workflow.
- A specific dark mode color palette and font (Inter) have been chosen for the UI aesthetics.
- **Significant Change:** Stages A, B, and C were merged into a single page component (`src/routes/character-creator/+page.svelte`) with a single save API endpoint (`src/routes/api/character/progress/complete/+server.ts`), deviating from the initial stage-by-stage page and API plan.
- **New Priority:** A comprehensive Vercel migration plan (`projectPlan/cleanVercelMigration.md`) has been adopted to address persistent deployment failures. This plan involves creating a new `dc20-clean` directory and a new GitHub repository, with incremental testing and deployment to Vercel at each phase.
