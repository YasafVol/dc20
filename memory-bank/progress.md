# Progress

This document summarizes the current status of the project, including what has been completed, what remains, and any known issues.

## What Works

- The memory bank documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the project plan detailed in the `projectPlan/` directory.
- The core technologies, UI design principles, MVP feature scope, data modeling (Prisma schema), key backend logic, key frontend logic, and specific planning decisions for the Level 1 Character Creator MVP have been documented.
- Detailed plans for Stage A (Attributes) and Stage B (Ancestry) of the character creation wizard have been incorporated into the documentation.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement the frontend Svelte component and logic for Stage A (Attributes).
- Implement the backend endpoint/Form Action for Stage A data persistence and validation.
- Implement the frontend Svelte component and logic for Stage B (Ancestry), including the attribute overflow helper panel.
- Implement the backend endpoint/Form Action for Stage B data persistence and validation.
- Detail and implement Stage C (Class) of the character creation wizard.
- Implement the backend logic for final character calculation and `CharacterSheetData` creation.
- Implement the frontend component for displaying the finalized character sheet.
- Implement the basic resume functionality using browser `localStorage`.
- Configure TailwindCSS based on `tailwind.config.js`.
- Implement static rule data in TypeScript files (`src/lib/rulesdata/`).

## Current Status

The project is in the planning and initial documentation phase for the MVP of the Level 1 Character Creator. The core requirements, scope, and technical approach are defined. Detailed plans for the first two stages of the wizard are documented. The next steps involve translating these plans into code, starting with Stage A.

## Known Issues

- Stage C of the character creation wizard is not yet detailed in the planning documents.
- The implementation of static rule data in TypeScript files needs to be completed.
- The attribute overflow helper panel logic in Stage B requires careful implementation and testing to ensure correct attribute reallocation and validation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to initially store static rule data in TypeScript files was made for simplicity during the MVP phase, with a potential future plan to move it to the database.
- The character creation wizard stages were re-ordered from the original DC20 steps to A-Attributes, B-Ancestry, C-Class, D-Background, E-Review, F-Equipment for a more streamlined digital workflow.
- A specific dark mode color palette and font (Inter) have been chosen for the UI aesthetics.
