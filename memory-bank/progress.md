# Progress

This document summarizes the current status of the project, including what has been completed, what remains, and any known issues.

## What Works

- **Stage 0 (Foundation and UI Setup) Completed:**
    - Functional SvelteKit project initialized and configured.
    - TailwindCSS installed and configured with the project's custom theme, verified.
    - The Inter font loaded and applied.
    - Melt UI (`@melt-ui/svelte`) installed, and its preprocessor (`@melt-ui/pp`) correctly configured.
    - `projectPlan/stage0.md` updated.
- The memory bank documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the project plan detailed in the `projectPlan/` directory.
- The core technologies, UI design principles, MVP feature scope, data modeling (Prisma schema), key backend logic, key frontend logic, and specific planning decisions for the Level 1 Character Creator MVP have been documented.
- Detailed plans for Stage A (Attributes) and Stage B (Ancestry) of the character creation wizard have been incorporated into the documentation.
- Static rule data in TypeScript files (`src/lib/rulesdata/`) has been implemented based on the DC20 Beta 0.9.5 rulebook.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement the frontend Svelte component and logic for Stage A (Attributes).
- Implement the backend endpoint/Form Action for Stage A data persistence and validation.
- Implement the frontend Svelte component and logic for Stage B (Ancestry), including the attribute overflow helper panel.
- Implement the backend endpoint/Form Action for Stage B data persistence and validation.
- Detail and implement Stage C (Class) of the character creation wizard.
- Implement the backend logic for final character calculation and `CharacterSheetData` creation.
- Implement the frontend component for displaying the finalized character sheet.
- Implement the basic resume functionality using browser `localStorage`.

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed Stage 0 (Foundation and UI Setup). The SvelteKit application has a stable and verified UI foundation, including TailwindCSS with the custom theme, the Inter font, and a working Melt UI installation with its preprocessor. The core requirements, scope, and technical approach are defined. Detailed plans for the first two wizard stages (A and B) are documented. The next steps involve translating these plans into code, starting with the implementation of Stage A (Attributes).

## Known Issues

- Stage C of the character creation wizard is not yet detailed in the planning documents.
- The attribute overflow helper panel logic in Stage B requires careful implementation and testing to ensure correct attribute reallocation and validation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The SvelteKit project was initialized manually to work within the existing project structure.
- The necessity of installing and configuring the `@melt-ui/pp` preprocessor for Melt UI was identified and implemented during Stage 0.
- The decision to initially store static rule data in TypeScript files was made for simplicity during the MVP phase, with a potential future plan to move it to the database.
- The character creation wizard stages were re-ordered from the original DC20 steps to A-Attributes, B-Ancestry, C-Class, D-Background, E-Review, F-Equipment for a more streamlined digital workflow.
- A specific dark mode color palette and font (Inter) have been chosen for the UI aesthetics.
